## Overview

This project exposes a machine learning model as a production-style REST API that estimates **risk levels for a motorcycle ride** given contextual features (weather, distance, visibility, time of day, and rider experience).

The goal was to go beyond a local notebook model and build something closer to what an engineer would ship:
a **reproducible pipeline**, a **clean FastAPI service**, and a **cloud deployment** with live documentation.

The project is fully open-source and available on GitHub:

- **GitHub:** [LINK](https://github.com/anmolmalik95/motorcycle-risk-prediction-api)  
- **Live Demo:** [Render](https://motorcycle-risk-prediction-api.onrender.com/docs#/risk/predict_api_v1_risk_predict_risk_post)

## Problem Framing

Motorcyclists routinely make ride/no-ride decisions under uncertainty: changing weather, distance, visibility, time of day, and their own skill level.  

Instead of hand-wavy “it looks risky”, this project asks:

> *Given a set of riding conditions, what is the predicted risk level for this ride?*

The API returns a **numerical risk score** (and interpretable categories) that can be used for:

- Pre-ride decision support (“Should I still ride?”)
- Scenario analysis (“What if I leave earlier / later?”)
- Education (“How much does rain or low visibility really affect risk?”)

---

## Data & Features

The model is trained on a structured dataset representing ride conditions and outcomes.  
The core features include:

- `temp` – temperature at time of ride  
- `rainfall` – rainfall / precipitation intensity  
- `visibility` – approximate visibility range  
- `distance` – trip distance  
- `time_of_day` – encoded representation of when the ride starts  
- `experience` – rider experience level  
- `risk` – target label (e.g. low / medium / high or a continuous risk score)

The dataset uses a mix of **synthetic and realistically-inspired patterns**, designed to reflect plausible relationships between conditions and risk while remaining fully anonymised and safe to share.

---

## Modelling Approach

The project uses a classic supervised learning setup:

- **Model family:** Random Forest
- **Library:** scikit-learn
- **Pipeline:**
  - feature selection and preprocessing
  - train/validation split
  - model training and evaluation with appropriate metrics
- **Outputs:**
  - a persisted model artefact (`.pkl`) for use in the API
  - evaluation metrics (e.g. accuracy / F1 or regression metrics depending on framing)

The emphasis is not on squeezing out the last 0.5% of performance, but on **clean structure**, **reproducibility**, and **serving the model in a realistic way**.

---

## API Design & Implementation

The model is served via a **FastAPI** application, exposing a simple, well-typed endpoint:

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/risk/predict`  
- **Input:** JSON body with the core riding features  
- **Output:** predicted risk score + human-readable interpretation

Implementation highlights:

- **FastAPI + Pydantic** for request/response validation and automatic OpenAPI schema.
- **Dedicated prediction service layer** that loads the model artefact and handles inference.
- **Separation of concerns** between:
  - model training script
  - API app
  - configuration
- **Automatic interactive docs** at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`.

The live docs are available here:

- https://motorcycle-risk-prediction-api.onrender.com/docs#/risk/predict_api_v1_risk_predict_risk_post

---

## Deployment

The API is deployed on **Render**, using:

- A `Dockerfile`-free, Python service deployment (or container, depending on setup)
- Environment configuration for dependencies
- A startup command that runs the FastAPI app with Uvicorn

This mimics a **realistic ML deployment path**:

1. Train locally
2. Persist the model artefact
3. Package the serving code
4. Deploy to a managed cloud service
5. Verify via live docs and test calls

---

## Example Usage

A typical request to the API looks like:

```json
{
  "temp": 30,
  "rainfall": 0.4,
  "visibility": 5,
  "distance": 80,
  "time_of_day": "night",
  "experience": "beginner"
}
